"Simple routine = stress free morning. 🙆🏻‍♀️ Clockwise starting from top left: my daily facial oil, lip balm in a compostable tube, liquid foundation (only for when I'm on camera!), facial cleansing bar, washable makeup rounds from @packagefreeshop, an old bamboo toothbrush that I use to tame my eyebrows, two different types of highlighters, blush, and a lipstick for when I'm feeling fancy. 💁🏻‍♀️ Do you have any questions about my daily routine? Let me know! 💄"

Can you tag where the products are from? Interested in the highlighter and blush!
Question: I have been looking for facial oils/serums but most have a plastic topper like yours. Is your brand refillable or what do you do with the top when you finish the bottle ?
What about SPF?
Do you use mascara? If so what kind?
Whats your facial oil?
"Any hair products? I have thick dry hair, a little something to tame it would be great!"
Is the brand @kjaerweis 😘
What is this facial bar?
What is your brow routine?
What is your facial Cleansing bar and do you like it?
Hi! I wondering how you recycle the bottle for the facial oil? What is the dropper made of? love you page 💕
What kind of toner do you use?
@didishavemylegsforthis I buy cake mascara from Etsy! It comes in a metal tin and lasts forever.
👏👏👏 seeing clean care routines all laid out puts a smile on my face! Keep up the awesome work for our environment!
Where do you get the lio balm compostable tube?
🙏🏻
How do you make the toothpaste
@readmckenziereed oooo thanks ill look into that!!
Lauren what should I use for floss?
@didishavemylegsforthis I use cake mascara from @besamecosmetics. It comes in a metal tin. I also use it as eyeliner.
@meowmeowtweet
"@windertheworld I use the same lip balm. It is made by @meowmeowtweet. Hope that helps. You can also use it as a balm on your hands, elbows and feet."
What about sunscreen?
@airedogs oh wow! Thanks so much! I use so much lip balm and am always concious it only comes in plastic 🙄
How did you make washable makeup rounds?
"Hi Lauren! If you don't have a glass shower door and have to use a shower curtain, what would you recommend using to avoid those pesky plastic liners? The washable fabric ones get gross after a while and allow a lot of water to escape too - I'm not sure if they can even be recycled. Any ideas would help. Thanks and keep up the awesome work you do!"
I have struggled with acne for a really long time so I often order my products online to help keep it manageable.. it’s just regular “teen” acne. I’m not sure if this is ever something you’ve struggled with or if your face wash/ moisturizer would be good for people with acne too? Sorry if you’ve addressed this before 💗
"Where do you get your makeup? I’m assuming its natural, and is it refillable, or is the package recyclable?"
@windertheworld maybe you could look into using raw shea butter. Its good for the whole body i use it for lipbalm or for my elbows and arms&hands. Most of the commercial lip balms dry your lips out more as you apply them to make you use more and more
@vanessaleblanc99 Recycling
@wallflowerzee Did you try proofing them with a beeswax-jojoba-oil coat 😉
Or a wax bar for raincoats or Fjällräven backpacks
@majcibaba yes! My husband has mentioned that a few times about drying the lips out. That's a great ideA!
@livfreefit i have the same struggles.. like in order to keep my skin relatively in order (still havin pimples but they go away faster due to my routine) so i need to use black soap almost on a daily basis combined with a very powerful soother made of ichtiol and some herbs. Even if i domt use make up for a day or so i need to have these items. Nearly impossible to get them in a zerowaste packaging 😟 In addition I also need my facial and body creme which is handmade by my mom's friend. Is your problem similar?
@majcibaba yesssssss I use Clinique 3 in 1 bc i really need salycilic acid and benzoyl peroxide to help :( and it’s so hard to find zero waste for acne products
@vanessaleblanc99 this oil is refillable at @packagefreeshop ✨
@bettanbettanbettanbettan I use natural oils as sun protection like Shea butter and raspberry seed oil. I also look for bulk sunscreen or natural handmade sunscreen in my local natural food store. You can also shop sunscreen on @packagefreeshop 🤗
@maga.linalalala this is Meow Meow Tweet Organic Face Oil 🤗
@hayleylamb13 you can check out my hair care routine and all the products I use on my blog or YouTube channel! 💗
@mrsluccik this is the Tea Tree Charcoal Facial Bar Soap from @packagefreeshop 💗

"@windertheworld seconding what @airedogs said, this is from Meow Meow Tweet 🤗"
@dianaydingozova you can check out my zero waste homemade toothpaste recipe on my blog 🤗👏🏼
@noahhjc I use 100% cotton dental floss and then compost it when I am done ✨💗
"@anusha_sarma I use natural oils as sun protection like Shea butter or raspberry seed oil, but I avoid being in the sun for extended periods of time to avoid burning. I also look for bulk sunscreen or natural handmade sunscreen in my local natural food store. You can also shop sunscreen at @packagefreeshop 🤗✨"
@_lyudaserg these are from @packagefreeshop 💗
That’s my girl! 💕💕💕
@trashisfortossers so nice :) pity I can not buy them..
"@wallflowerzee Thank you! If you have to use a liner you can use a cloth, hemp, or cotton curtain. They can be washed periodically like you can wash your sheets. Or if you own your place, big hardware stores sell easy to install glass shower panels. I hope this helps! 💗"
What is the makeup?
Is this the order you do your skin care!
"@_lyudaserg you don’t have to buy them! Just get some old fabric, cut a few layers if it’s thin, and sew the edges. If you’re worried about fraying then whip stitch around the edges."
Hi Lauren! What kind of mascara would you recommend? Are there zero waste (vegan cruelty free) alternatives?
What’s the makeup brand you use?
"Please update the zerowastepet, i really wanna know how you get rid of pet's litter?"
"Have you had any problems not having fluoride in your homemade toothpaste? If so, what do you do? Is there a way to add fluoride?"
@trashisfortossers yeah how do you keep your skin so flawless???
That looks like a great routine! Thank you for sharing!
@trashisfortossers I would love to buy it from your shop. But I'm all the way across the pond in sunny Scotland. Will have to look fo something alike over here
@trashisfortossers thanks!
"Hi. As a student I use a lot of paper, a lot of notebooks , a lot of paints and these . I recycle my old more but any tips?"
O you recommended that silicone cup for some who is active and is busy all day?
"@catajofre the makeup featured here is from @vapourbeauty and @kjaerweis, both are organic! Vapour Beauty’s packaging is made with wind power and is 100% recyclable and Kjaer Weis’ packaging is refillable 👏🏼💗"
@kateydenno 💗💗💗
@katshea30 the makeup seen here is from @vapourbeauty and @kjaerweis 💗
"I wear tinted sunscreen religiously from responsible, vegan brands, but they still haven’t phased out plastic. I read you shouldn’t make your own because it’s impossible to gauge what SPF you’re creating (unless you just white out your face w/ zinc.) Nor do I have the time or motivation to make my own. Sunscreen has actually helped me reverse some aging so it’s a staple. Any suggestions on good brands or refills I may not know? But no beeswax please. Thanks!"
@josidunbar1 you can check out my full skincare routine on my blog or YouTube channel! 💗🤗
@motherofisaiahanthony the makeup seen here is @vapourbeauty and @kjaerweis 💗✨
"@still.alive.but for cats you can use a compostable litter, upcycle and then compost newspaper, flush the poop, or toilet train your cat!"
"@bethdoman many municipal water systems already contain fluoride, including New York City, so I do not add it to my toothpaste!"
@ainssuoh 💗💗 you can check out my full skincare routine on my blog or YouTube channel!
@kelly.ann.carpenter of course 🤗💗 I’m glad you think so!
@trashisfortossers thank you
I am so excited as I just ordered your premium razor and conditioner bar!
I really hope to see more major make up brands choosing sustainable options in their packing. Like lots of ppl want certain products n I don’t blame anyone but it sucks that their only option comes with lots of packaging :/
Any recommendations for zeroish waste mascara?
"What’s the best way to wash the cotton rounds? I feel like mine always have some makeup left, even after washing. Thank you! 💜"
Hi Lauren! I just purchased the travel soap box from @packagefreeshop! I was surprised that it came with a sticker on the bottom and I was not aware of it. I am just letting you know just in case somebody missed it! You have been such my inspiration for months and I really admire you and your shop! Cannot wait to visit the actual store in a few weeks💓✨
"Share more stuff like this it’s SO helpful, I’m new to the zero waste game and it’s very overwhelming trying to figure out the best routine/products to have an organised/stress free/minimalistic environment"
@nutritionistar I try my best to avoid plastic in general 😉
Have you heard of @elatecosmetics? They’re Canadian but vegan and eco-friendly 😌
Have you ever found a nice plastic-free lotion/cream rather than oil? My skin tends to prefer it. ❤️
I spy some with my eco eye some #brushwithbamboo Woohoo!!! 💚🙌🌿😍
@trashisfortossers thank you!!
@trashisfortossers - thank you! 💚
Mascara?
How do you wash your washable makeup rounds? Mine are nasty looking
Where do you buy the facial soap bar? The brand?
Do you have a night time oil you use? Or is it the same one? @trashisfortossers
What is that facial oil that you use?
what can dudes do?
Love the simplicity!
No SPF?!
Is the featured face oil available @packagefreeshop?
What foundation do u use?
"@vanessaleblanc99 So do I! I reuse the droppers and make my own fave oil using bulk-bought oils and essential oils. Also making your own lipbalm is so easy, no need to buy one!"
Where do you recommend buying the best zero/minimal waste makeup products?
Yes how many things are made of plastics
@turbosquirrell thanks :) will tru
How do u like the MMTT deodorant?
What brand/kind of makeup do you use that doesn't come in plastic packaging?
Don't you use any mascara?
@windertheworld 😊 worth the try i think and i love using it bec ut works 🖤
@livfreefit exactly 🙄😕 im actually getting my product through my beautician so im sure its the right one and been asking for zerowaste packaging.. i guess i just gotta push more😊 As for salycilic acid be careful. My old beautician suggested me to use it every day which i did but it wasnt good routine as it dries the skin out very bad. You can still use it but on much less intensive basis like once a month every two week or such🙂
@livfreefit let me know if you found a zerowaste alternative for your products..im only halfway through 😅
So simple! I wish I could de-clutter all my cosmetics so that this could be my reality too
"No, it seems close to perfect💚"
"Ma'am What Kind Of Footwear Do You Use .

How do you recycle/dispose of the makeup products at the end of their lives?
What do you use for mascara ? I’ve made many versions of my own but they all flake or bleed
@trashisfortossers are these brands plastic free??
@itamueller
"I love this. I make my own lip balm, but struggle to find the compostable tube. Can you help at all? 🙏🏼"
@maliawmalia 😍 danke!
Is the facial oil like a moisturizer? If so does it leave your face oily or greasy looking?
Isn’t the foundation packaged in plastic ☺️?

@trashisfortossers Is even the Vapour foundation cap metal? Do you have a list anywhere of all of the products you use? Trying soooo hard to make changes.
